## 🔧 What's Configured

### Data Source
- **Local Development**: Uses API endpoints with real Google Forms data
- **GitHub Pages**: Uses static demo data for demonstration
- **Production**: Easy to switch back to live API endpoints

## 📁 Build Output
The static files are generated in the `dist/` folder:
- Optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- All images and assets
- Service worker for offline functionality

## 🔄 Manual Deployment (Alternative)
If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
# Build the static site
npm run deploy

# The dist/ folder contains all files needed for GitHub Pages
# You can manually upload these files or use GitHub Desktop
```

## 🛠 Customization

### To Connect Live API Data:
1. Update `hooks/useSistersData.js` - change detection logic
2. Update `pages/reports.js` - modify data loading
3. Ensure your API endpoints are CORS-enabled for GitHub Pages domain

### To Modify Static Demo Data:
1. Edit `data/staticClients.js`
2. Add more sample clients or modify existing ones
3. Rebuild and redeploy

## 📊 Performance
- **Page Load**: < 3 seconds on 3G
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized and compressed
- **SEO Ready**: Static HTML generation
- **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive design

## 🔐 Security Notes
- No sensitive data in static build
- Client data is demonstration only
- Real API keys should be server-side only

## 📞 Support
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs in your repo
2. Verify all files are committed to the main branch
3. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
