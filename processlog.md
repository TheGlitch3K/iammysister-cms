### May 24, 2025 - Major Modularization & Sisters Page Enhancement

#### Sisters Page Modularization
- **Issue**: Original sisters.js exceeded 800 lines, violating project guidelines
- **Solution**: Broke down into focused, reusable components:

**New Components Created:**
1. `components/Sisters/SistersHeader.js` - Navigation header component
2. `components/Sisters/SistersFilters.js` - Filter controls (status, program, priority, credit range, income range)
3. `components/Sisters/SistersViewControls.js` - View mode toggle (grid/list) and sorting controls
4. `hooks/useSistersData.js` - Custom hook containing all data logic, filtering, sorting, and utilities

**Refactored Main File:**
- `pages/sisters.js` - Reduced from 800+ lines to ~400 lines
- Now focuses only on layout and component composition
- Clean separation of concerns

#### Enhanced Features Added:
- **View Mode Toggle**: Grid view (cards) and List view (compact rows)
- **Advanced Sorting**: 7 sorting options (newest, oldest, name, credit score, income, mental health, priority)
- **Sort Direction Control**: Ascending/descending toggle with visual indicators
- **Real-time Filtering**: All filters work together seamlessly
- **Priority-based Filtering**: Urgent (immediate needs), High (mental health ≤5), Normal (stable)
- **Credit Score Color Coding**: Green (700+), Yellow (600-699), Red (<600)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

#### Architecture Improvements:
- **Custom Hook Pattern**: `useSistersData` encapsulates all data logic
- **Component Composition**: Clean prop passing between components
- **Styled Components**: Consistent theming with IAMS brand colors
- **Performance Optimized**: Proper use of useEffect and dependency arrays

#### Data Integration:
- Real data from Google Forms via `/api/clients`
- No mock data - fully functional with production data
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Statistics calculation (total, active, high priority, housing ready)
